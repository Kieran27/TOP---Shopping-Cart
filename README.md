# Shopping Cart

Front End Shopping Cart application made with react and react router

## About

This is my first attempt at making a single page application within React. The user can view a home page, about page as well as a shop and cart page. The project makes use of react hooks such as useState and useEffect to compute values and render the correct output to the user.

### What I Learned

This project really helped reinforce using react router as well as key react principles such as passing state down to components and passing them back up to have a parent component as the single source of truth. The project was a lot of fun to build.

### What I would do differently

I would look into either using separate CSS files for the components or looking into styled components. As the CSS file is large and has a lot of duplicate markup.
I would also like to build some tests to test the core functionality of the application.
